SPiD can be used as a payent provider through a few different APIs. Below you
will find guides and working examples for three approaches, but it is
recommended to get a rough overview of each approach before diving in.

## Paylinks

With paylinks there is little setup, and you can have a working checkout process
in literally 10 minutes. With paylinks, there is no need to store products or
other data in SPiD - all you need is to inform SPiD via the REST API about the
contents of an order, and SPiD will give you back a checkout URL. The URL will
allow the user to pay and return to your site.
