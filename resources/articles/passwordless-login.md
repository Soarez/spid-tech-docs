The basic idea is that instead of using a password to authenticate each user, a temporary secret code is sent to him/her over an e-mail.

Itâ€™s almost as if the backend server makes up a temporary, one-use password each time a user wants to log in.

### Configuration

The Passwordless Login flow consists of these elements:

* an API endpoint for triggering a passwordless login flow
* user receives an email with a link (30 minutes expiration)
* once the user press the link: 
    * the user is logged in
    * if terms & agreements acceptance is needed, the user is presented with the acceptance step, otherwise this is skipped
* when logged in state is successful, the user is redirected back to the client provided and validated redirectUrl
