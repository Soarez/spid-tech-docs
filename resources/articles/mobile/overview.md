Using SPiD you will gain access to a single sign-on system consisting of users from all Schibsted subsidiaries connected to SPiD as well as simplifying the user experience and increasing your conversion rate.

The SPiD mobile SDKs provides components that simplify integrating SPiD into your app. Login is handled using [OAuth 2.0](/mobile/oauth-authentication-on-mobile-devices) and a number of different login methods are supported; natively, using an external browser, webview, Facebook or Google+.
