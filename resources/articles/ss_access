Our self service tool gives developers control over their SPiD API client implementation. 

## In Selfservice you will be able to manage your client settings such as: 
Create API clients
Add/edit redirect urls
Manage Ambassador user management access

## In order to access Selfservice: 

1. You will need to register your work e-mail as a SPiD user on: 
stage.payment.schibsted.se / payment.schibsted.se
stage.payment.schibsted.no / payment.schibsted.no

- If your company already has SPiD implemented: 
2A. Ask your tech lead (or the person in your company with Admin responsibility in Selfservice) to send an 
e-mail to: support@spid.no stating which client/s you need access to and the e-mail address registrered. 

- If your company is new to SPiD (does not have a Merchant/Company registered):
2B. Your project tech lead will need to send an e-mail to support@spid.no and request a that SPiD enables 
merchant/company access with the information stating which client/s you need access to and the e-mail address registrered.
