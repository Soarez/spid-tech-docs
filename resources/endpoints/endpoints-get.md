:introduction

Get a list with descriptions of all endpoints.

You can also fetch information about a single endpoint, but this is
merely a network efficiency feature. The exact same information is
provided (i.e., there are no further details than what's available
from the full listing), but the payload is much smaller than fetching
the whole listing.
