 :description "This endpoint returns the currently logged in user's object. It
requires an active user session and a matching oauth token corresponding to this
user.

A session is only created when the user logs in through the web â€“ not through
the native/facebook login for mobile apps. The
[/user/{id/userId}](/endpoints/user-id-userid) endpoint should be used for those
cases."
