:introduction

Store data objects associated with this user. The data objects API is a
general-purpose key-value store for storing user meta data. Data objects can be
any kind of data, with a few restrictions on size. SPiD does not know anything
about the type or purpose of the values, and any type information,
de-serializing etc must be done on the client.
