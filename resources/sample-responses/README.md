**NB!** These files are generated. **Do not edit.** Eventually there
will be a script to regenerate all of them, but for now you can
generate individual ones from the REPL:

```clj
(in-ns spid-docs.sample-responses)

;; Fetches a sample response from the /api/2/logins endpoint and writes it to
;; file (also returns the sample response)
(generate-sample-response "logins")
```
