;; Types used across many endpoints. Many types are defined inline for the

;; this is the place to define it, to enable cross-linking.

;; Types that don't have descriptions will not be linked. This is used for basic
;; types like strings and numbers.

`phoneNumber` fields will always contain the primary used for both if available.
The corresponding *Verified fields are the date of the last time those were
verified."
