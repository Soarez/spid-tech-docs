# The SPiD tech docs intro presentation

This branch contains the introduction to SPiD tech docs. It should never be
merged into the main branch, since that would replace the actual tech-docs site,
rendering this introduction moot. Please don't do that.

You can see the presentation on
[schibsted.github.io/spid-tech-docs/](http://schibsted.github.io/spid-tech-docs/).
There's also a live performance from 2014-08-22 to be found
[here in the SPiD Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/emdevcfd7u79jae/tech-docs.mp4).

Feel free to update these slides when things change. You can start the
presentation locally by going to the root folder and running
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`. All the slides are embedded in `index.html`,
one slide per `<section>`.
